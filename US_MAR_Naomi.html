        <strong>Naomi Njenga</strong><br>
        African Population and Health Research Center, Kenya

    <p>
      Naomi Njenga is a Monitoring and Evaluation Officer at the African Population and Health Research Center (APHRC), where she works within the Research Capacity Strengthening Division. In this role, she supports several initiatives across the division, including the Consortium for Advanced Research Training in Africa (CARTA), and plays a key role in tracking program progress, outputs, and impact. A central tool in her work is REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture), which she uses to manage monitoring and evaluation processes and program data.
    </p>

    

    <p>
      In her day-to-day responsibilities, Naomi uses REDCap to support monitoring and evaluation workflows, including administering targeted surveys, collecting fellows’ progress reports, and tracking research outputs over time. The platform is particularly valuable for managing longitudinal projects, allowing the team to follow fellows’ development across multiple years and systematically document milestones and achievements required by the program.
    </p>

    <p>
      Several REDCap features have proven especially impactful in her work. Its ability to support longitudinal data collection enables structured follow-up with fellows at different stages of their training. Automated reminders help ensure timely submission of reports, reducing manual follow-ups and easing administrative workload. In addition, REDCap’s centralized data storage and archiving capabilities ensure that information is securely stored, well organized, and easily accessible to authorized project users whenever needed. This improves efficiency, supports continuity, and strengthens accountability in program monitoring.
    </p>

    <p>
      Naomi has found REDCap to be highly adaptable, supporting both simple and complex surveys while maintaining reliability and ease of use. Beyond the platform itself, she highlights the value of the global REDCap user community, which actively shares knowledge and best practices through monthly calls and annual symposia. Participation in these forums has helped her enhance her technical skills and better utilize the platform’s features. Naomi strongly advocates for the adoption of REDCap by monitoring, evaluation, and research
